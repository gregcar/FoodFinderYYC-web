            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>BROWN BAGGING FOR CALGARY’S KIDS</strong> ("<strong>BB4CK</strong>" as further defined below) recognizes that your right to privacy is an important issue, and is committed to maintaining the accuracy, security and privacy of personal information in accordance with applicable law.  BB4CK is subject to the requirements of the Alberta Personal Information Protection Act ("<strong>PIPA</strong>") and other applicable personal information protection laws and the decisions of court or regulatory authorities (collectively, "<strong>Privacy Laws</strong>") and this Privacy Policy is intended to clarify BB4CK's practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of such personal information.  Nothing in this Privacy Policy will limit BB4CK's rights and obligations pursuant to such Privacy Laws.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Privacy Policy applies to personal information concerning BB4CK’s customers, clients, business partners, suppliers and similar third parties ("<strong>you</strong>") that is collected, used or disclosed by BB4CK.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that is protected by other BB4CK policies and practices or through contractual arrangements, unless specifically provided for in such contractual arrangements.
            </p>
            <h2>Your Consent</h2>
            <section style={{border: "1px solid #999"}} className="p-a-1">
              <h3>CONSENT</h3>
              <p>
                BY SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION TO BB4CK OR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND AGENTS, YOU AGREE THAT BB4CK AND ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND AGENTS MAY COLLECT, USE AND DISCLOSE SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND AS PERMITTED OR REQUIRED BY PRIVACY LAWS.  Subject to legal and contractual requirements, you may refuse or withdraw your consent to certain of the identified purposes at any time by contacting the BB4CK Privacy Officer.  If you refuse or withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you or continue to provide you with certain services or information which may be of value to you.  If you provide BB4CK or its service providers and agents with personal information of another individual, you represent that you have all necessary authority and/or have obtained all necessary consents from such person to enable us to collect, use and disclose such personal information for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please also note that, where BB4CK has requested your consent to collect, use or disclose your personal information in circumstances where such consent is not required under Privacy Laws, or BB4CK has otherwise done anything relative to your personal information not strictly required of it under Privacy Laws or obligations, BB4CK does not waive its rights under such Privacy Laws as a result thereof.
              </p>
            </section>
            <h2>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h2>
            <p>
              Personal information is information about <strong><em>an identifiable individual</em></strong>, as defined in applicable Privacy Laws.  Generally speaking, personal information does not include:
            </p>
            <ol className="alpha">
              <li>anonymous or aggregated information that does not allow an individual to be identified;</li>
              <li>information regarding companies and other “legal persons”; or</li>
              <li>business contact information such as your name, title or position, business address, telephone number or fax number, or business email address.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The types of personal information that BB4CK may collect from you from time to time include: your name, home address, home telephone number, personal email address, previous address(es), and customer service preferences.  In addition, from time to time, we may ask you to provide us with more detailed information regarding your interests, occupation and background.
            </p>
            <h2>The Privacy Principals BB4CK Follows</h2>
            <p>
              BB4CK collects, uses and discloses your personal information by employing “fair information practices” as described in the following ten privacy principles and embodied in Privacy Laws:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Accountability</strong>:  BB4CK is responsible for personal information under its control and as a result has designated an individual as the person who is accountable for BB4CK’s compliance with the ten principles ("<strong>Privacy Officer</strong>").  As such:
                </p>
                <ol className="alpha">
                  <li>
                    accountability for BB4CK’s compliance with the principles rests with the Privacy Officer, even though other individuals within BB4CK may be responsible for the day-to-day collection and processing of personal information.  In addition, other individuals within BB4CK may be delegated to act on behalf of the Privacy Officer;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    the identity of the Privacy Officer designated by BB4CK to oversee BB4CK’s compliance with the principles shall be made known upon request; and
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    BB4CK is responsible for personal information in its possession or custody, including information that has been transferred to a third party for processing. BB4CK shall use contractual or other means to provide a comparable level of protection while the information is being processed by a third party.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Identifying Purposes</strong>:  In general, BB4CK maycollect, use and disclose personal information about you in order to provide our customers with our services.  More specifically, BB4CK may collect, use and disclose your personal information for the following purposes:

                    to better customize the delivery of our products and services, including but not limited to the FoodFinder YYC (as defined below) products and services to our customers and clients.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    to develop and manage our business and operations.  This may include the sharing of personal information by and between BB4CK personnel and affiliated companies, partners, collaborators and with third party service providers and agents, for such purposes;
                  </li>
                  <li>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    to engage in business transactions, including the purchase, sale, lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal, securitization or financing involving BB4CK;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    to understand and respond to client, supplier and other third party needs and preferences, including to contact and communicate with such parties and to conduct surveys, research and evaluations;
                  </li>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    as permitted by, and to comply with, any legal or regulatory requirements or provisions; and
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    for any other purpose to which you consent.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  BB4CK will collect, use and disclose only that personal information necessary for the purposes that have been identified.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Consent</strong>: The knowledge and consent of the individual are required for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information, except as permitted by Privacy Laws.  Pursuant to this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge your consent to BB4CK’s collection, use and disclosure of your personal information, or the personal information of another individual which you provide to BB4CK, as stated above.  Generally, should a different purpose to the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information be proposed by BB4CK, BB4CK shall seek your consent at the same time it collects the information. However, BB4CK may seek consent to use and disclose personal information after it has been collected, but before it is used or disclosed, for a new purpose.  You may withdraw consent at any time to some or all of the purposes indicated in their Privacy Policy, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice.  Please note, however, that in some circumstances, we may not be able to provide you with our services if you withdraw your consent to our use of your personal information.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>NOTE</strong>: In certain circumstances under Privacy Laws, personal information can be collected, used, or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual. For example, legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the detection and prevention of fraud or for law enforcement, seeking the consent of the individual might defeat the purpose of collecting the information.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Limiting Collection</strong>:  The collection of personal information shall be limited to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by BB4CK.  Information shall be collected by fair and lawful means and may be collected from other sources including but not limited to credit bureaus or other third parties who represent that they have the right to disclose the information.  In most cases, collection shall be pursuant to appropriate contractual arrangements.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention:  Personal information shall not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required or permitted by Privacy Laws.  Personal information shall be retained only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes or as required by law.
